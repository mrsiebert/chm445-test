As the semester progresses, you will be required to perform similar calculations on your own in order to answer post-lab questions related to most laboratory experiments. It is thus in your interest to become confident and competent in using [Psi4](https://psicode.org/). You may find the [Psi4 manual](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html) useful. The information and exercises contained within this chapter serve as an excellent resource."
